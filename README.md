# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
The MNIST Dataset is a computer vision dataset comprising of the hand written digits 0 to 9. This project looks at digit recognition using a beginner friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

# Model Architecture
The model consists of the following layers:
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense

# Possible Advancements
- Callbacks like Early Stopping or reduce LR on plateau
- Fine tuning with keras tuner
- Visualization
